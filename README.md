This project is a fully functional assembler, linker and emulator written in C++.

The whole project was written from scratch, using only standard C++ libraries.
The project was developed in C++ and is built using the GNU C++ compiler.
The assembler, linker and emulator are built separately using separate build files and helper scripts.
Test input files for each part are available in the respective test directories.


This project was completed in 2021 as part of the *System Software* course at the University Of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering (ETF).
